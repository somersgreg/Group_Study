# group_study

## Start of Project MVP 
- [ ] Create an App that displays the TL's and Students in our study group in a fun way
- [ ] Provide a description of what our study group is
- [ ] List the things you did well last unit (think about our discussions)
- [ ] List the things you want to improve (think about our discussions) 
- [ ] Style the app

## Stretch 
- [ ] Give the ability to add users to our unit
- [ ] Give the ability to edit users
- [ ] Give the ability to delete users
- [ ] Do not do everything all on the landing page, incorporate react router and have 1 page that displays the class and another that allows you to update, edit and delete members of the class
